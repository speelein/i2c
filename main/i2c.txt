Basic I2C Master Example
(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

Overview
This example demonstrates basic usage of I2C driver by reading and writing from a I2C connected sensor:

If you have a new I2C application to go (for example, read the temperature data from external sensor with I2C interface), try this as a basic template, then add your own code.

How to use example
Hardware Required
To run this example, you should have an Espressif development board based on a chip listed in supported targets as well as a MPU9250. MPU9250 is a inertial measurement unit, which contains a accelerometer, gyroscope as well as a magnetometer, for more information about it, you can read the datasheet of the MPU9250 sensor.

Pin Assignment
Note: The following pin assignments are used by default, you can change these in the menuconfig .

SDA	SCL
ESP I2C Master	I2C_MASTER_SDA	I2C_MASTER_SCL
MPU9250 Sensor	SDA	SCL
For the actual default value of I2C_MASTER_SDA and I2C_MASTER_SCL see Example Configuration in menuconfig.

Note: There's no need to add an external pull-up resistors for SDA/SCL pin, because the driver will enable the internal pull-up resistors.

Build and Flash
Enter idf.py -p PORT flash monitor to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type Ctrl-].)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

Example Output
I (328) example: I2C initialized successfully
I (338) example: WHO_AM_I = 71
I (338) example: I2C de-initialized successfully
